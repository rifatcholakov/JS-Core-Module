<h2>About the course</h2>

The <b>"JavaScript Application"(JS Apps)</b> course develops practical skills for building front-end applications with <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>JQuery</b>, <b>ReactJS</b>, <b>AJAX</b> and <b>REST services</b>. The course is bases of the current JS technologies (<b>ES2017</b> is used).

<b>HTTP</b>, <b>REST</b>, <b>jQuery</b>, <b>AJAX</b> and accessing <b>REST services</b> with AJAX queries. JavaScript and REST-based client applications are build to retrive and visualize data from public REST APIs such as GitHub API, TheMovieDb API, and creating / editing / deleteng (CRUD) through REST authenticated services. Consideration is also being given to building backend REST services on cloud-based platforms for data storage(<b>backend-as-a-service</b> / BaaS).

The <b>asynchronous principles</b> in JavaScript are studied with <b>promises</b>, <b>async</b>/<b>await</b> and <b>Web workers</b> as well as <b>Web storage</b>(cookies, session and local storage) and the use of help libraries, tools and technologies like <b>Babel</b> transpiler, <b>Grunt</b> and <b>Gulp</b>, <b>ESLint</b>, <b>loadash</b>, <b>sammy</b> and others.

For creating <b>user interface</b>(UI) and visualization of data by template(templating) is used the <b>ReactJS</b> technology, which provides a modern model for building responsive, reusible JavaScript UI components by combining <b>HTML</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.

The course participants combine to build <b>SPA</b>(single-page-application), based on <b>MVC</b> architecture (model-view-controller) with <b>ReactJS</b> for the UI part, <b>Sammy.js</b> (for routing and events) and <b>jQuery AJAX</b> (to call REST services from an existing REST API).

The course is <b>highly practice oriented</b>, with a tremendous amount of classroom exercises, a team project, and a practical exam. The participants in the course develop a <b>team project</b> (SPA application with MVC, REST and ReactJS). For the exam, the course ends with an <b>exam</b> on building a front-end SPA application with JS, jQuery AJAX, REST services and ReactJS. In case of good performance during the course and the final exam, a <b>certificate</b> for acquired skills is issued.

The course is part of the complete program with <b><a href="https://softuni.bg/professions/javascript">JavaScript courses and tutorials for the "JavaScript programmer" training</a></b> at the Software University.
