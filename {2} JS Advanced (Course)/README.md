<h2>About the course</h2>

The <b>"JavaScript Advanced"</b> course extends the skills gained in the <a href="https://softuni.bg/trainings/1850/js-fundamentals-january-2018">"JavaScript Fundamentals" course</a> with more complex concepts and principles from functional programming (<b>FP</b>) and object-oriented programming (<b>PLO</b>) with JavaScript, as well as using <b>DOM</b> to process elements in a web page. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (<b>modern JavaScript</b> is being studied with <b>ES2017</b>).

The course starts by studying the JavaScript object model of the browser(DOM and BOM) and interacting with it from JavaScript: searching, editing and deleting <b>DOM tree</b> elements, <b>event</b> processing, interaction with the web browser.

In-depth study of <b>functions</b> and paradigms from <b>functional programming</b> (FP): function as object, functional expressions, higher-order functions, IIFE, JS objects and JSON, object composition, higher order functions, closure, JS templates such as revealing module, prototype object inheritance, and prototype chain, work with generators and iterators.

<b>Objective-oriented programming</b> (PLO) with <b>JavaScript classes</b>: class defining, constructors, properties and methods, class inheritance, antitype chains, polymorphism, other types of PLO and inheritance are examined. Serious attention is paid to <b>unit testing</b> and its application in software engineering to build quality software.

Working with <b>Module systems</b> such as ES6 modules, CommonJS, RequireJS, module dependency management, transpellers such as Babel, error handling and exception handling, established practices and templates for writing quality and reusable JavaScript code.

The course is <b>highly focused on practice</b>, with a huge number of exercises, a practical team project, and a practical exam. The tasks of the exercises and exams are evaluated automatically with the online judging system.

The course ends with a <b>practical JavaScript exam</b> for functional and PLO programming and DOM with automated assessment with an online judging system.
