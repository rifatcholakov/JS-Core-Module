<h2>About the course</h2>

The <b>"JavaScript Fundamentals"</b> course builds basic programming skills with <b>JavaScript</b>. JavaScript constructions for building programming logic are studied, data types, operators, expressions, conditional constructions, cycles, and functions. Attention is drawn to work with arrays, strings and regular expressions, use of objects, associative arrays and sets. The course is based on current standards and JS technologies (<b>ES2017</b> is being studied).

The course is highly <b>practice oriented</b>, with a huge number of class exercises and a practical exam. All tasks in the exercises and exams are automatically evaluated with the online judging system.

Participants have the opportunity to take part in a separate course for creating a <b>team project</b> (JavaScript Single Page Application) that covers all the training material.

The course ends with a <b>practical JavaScript programming exam</b> with automated evaluation of online judging system.

The course <b>is not suitable for beginners</b>. Initial programming skills (data handling, checks, iterations) are required, regardless of the programming language and at least basic knowledge of the HTML language.

Basic knowledge of JavaScript is needed for anyone who wants to deal with something related to <b>web development</b> or <b>server JavaScript development</b>.

The course is part of the complete program with <b><a href="https://softuni.bg/professions/javascript">JavaScript courses and tutorials for the "JavaScript programmer" training</a></b> at the Software University.
